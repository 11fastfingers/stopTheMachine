                <h2>AI will take our jobs.</h2>
                <p> In ten years time, up to 50% of our jobs could vanish as AI replaces human labour across industries.</p>

                <h2>AI will destabalize society.</h2>
                <p> Over the next 20 years, AI threatens to: 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Seize control of news and media through mass disinformation</li>
                        <li>Collapse higher education as credentials lose value</li>
                        <li>Undermine the legal system and courts</li>
                        <li>Disrupt governments and political stability worldwide</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>AI could wipe out humanity. </h2>
                <p> AI is the greatest existential threat to humanity. While individual estimates vary, all serious experts agree that the risk is real - and rising. 
                    Some estimate a 10% chance of extinction over the next 100 years. Others warn it may be as high as 90%. 
                </p>
                
                <h2>Time is running out</h2>
                <p> We have 5 to 15 years before Artificial General Intelligence is created. Once that happens, it's game over. Humans become irrelevant - and likely extinct.
                    We must act now to prevent the creation of an artificial superintelligence. AI is a threat to me, it is a threat to you, it is a threat to all of us.
                    We must act now - before it is too late. 
                </p>

                <h2> What can we do about it?</h2>
                <ol>
